# OverTheWire Wargames 🛡️

Welcome to my repository dedicated to solving [Overthewire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) Wargames, a series of challenges designed to sharpen skills in Linux, networking, and cybersecurity.

### About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and insights as I navigate through the wargames offered by OverTheWire. Each challenge is a step closer to mastering key cybersecurity concepts and practical problem-solving skills.

## Wargames Included 🕹️ 

📌 **Bandit**:

The Bandit wargame on OverTheWire is a series of Linux-based challenges designed to teach the basics of hacking, security, and system administration through a series of progressively difficult levels, where players must use command-line tools, cryptography, and other skills to find passwords hidden in various files and systems.

Some Key Concepts Covered:

- 🔐 **File Permissions and Ownership**  
- 🛠️ **Basic Linux Commands**  
- 🔑 **SSH Authentication and Keys**  
- 🔄 **Redirection and Pipelines**  
- 🖥️ **Scripting**

📌 **Krypton**:

The Krypton wargame focuses on the fundamentals of cryptography. Players will explore the history and evolution of cryptographic techniques, from classical ciphers to more modern encryption methods. This wargame emphasizes understanding how ciphers work, how they can be broken, and the importance of secure implementations.

Key Concepts Covered:

- 🧩 Classical ciphers (e.g., Caesar cipher, Vigenère cipher).
- 🔑 Encryption and decryption techniques.
- 🔍 Analyzing cipher weaknesses.
- 🚩 Understanding the importance of key management and secure communication.

***Levels***:

Levels 0-5: ✅ Completed

Level 6: 🚧 In Progress
