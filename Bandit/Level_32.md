This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```

We are asked to push a file called *key.txt* containing the phrase `May I come in?`. To do this, we first create the file:

```sh
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ echo "May I come in?">key.txt
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ cat key.txt 
May I come in?
```

We need to push it to the master branch. To do this, we first add the file to the Git index, then commit the changes, and finally push it to the master branch.

```sh
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ ls
key.txt  README.md
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ git add -f "key.txt"
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ git commit -m "Nuevo archivo"
[master 0c268ec] Nuevo archivo
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 key.txt
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SPas68UMEl/repo$ git push -u origin master
```

After doing this, we obtain the password:
